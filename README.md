# Data Operations for Wine Reviews Using SQL and R

**Author:** Runjini Murthy

__*Project Description:*__
Using a wine review data set from Kaggle, SQL and R will be used to perform basic analysis on the data contained within this file.  Within SQL, the following queries will be made:
1. How many countries are represented on this list?
2. What is the max points/rating for a given wine?
3. What is the minimum points/rating for a given wine?
4. How many wines have a perfect score of 100?
5. How many wines have the low score of 80?
6. What is the average points rating?
7. What countries are represented on this list?
8. How many review descriptions contain the word "oak"?
9. Provide all information on wines from India.
10. What is the max price of wine on this table?

Additionally in R, the following questions will be asked:
1. How do you assign a variable?
2. How do you perform a sum on a column?
3. How do you perform a mean on a column?
4. How do you filter?
5. How do you perform a sum/mean on a subset of data?
